Everytime I asked to anything about a software portofolio, it's always about the task manager.

So, I decided to make a simple task manager. Inpired by JIRA

## Features

- Add task
- Delete task
- Edit task
- Mark task as done
- Mark task as undone


The frontend is made with React and the backend is made with Golang (but I also made backend with NodeJS NestJS)
